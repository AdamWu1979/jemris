URGENT FOR ESMRMB
-----------------
- SNR, receiver bandwidth 
- MATLAB:	* coilgui
		* plotall->sim_plot
		* cluser call ; mypbs -> pbs_script.txt in ./matlab
		* second definition of writing samples

- revisit RunTree

Eddy Currents in JEMRIS
-----------------------

1. definition of a new class, defining pulses with restricted life time:

  TransientPulses : public Pulse {...} 

  - these pulses delete them self from the tree, if they are finished
  - these pulses do not alter the length of an atomic sequence
  - these pulses transfer to the next atom, if they are still active
  - usually, these pulses are not part of the XML tree, but they are
    dynamically inserted into the tree by other modules


2. definition of the EddyCurrent class:

  EddyCurrent : public TransientPulse {...}

  ... or even cooler
  EddyCurrent : public Gradient, public TransientPulse {...}

  - instantiation and preparation of these pulses take place during
    runtime (getValue()) of the invoking module. usually an AtomicSequence

  - compute their waveform from all Gradients within the invoking
    AtomicSequence and, possibly, any Gradient(s) within the next Atom
