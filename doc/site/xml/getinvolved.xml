<h1 class="isFirstInSlot">Get involved</h1>

<p><b>jemris</b> is distributed under GPLv3 license as a spare time
  project at the Department of Medical Imaging Physics.</p>
<p>We would like to encourage collegues to get involved in further
  developing it. We have some open projects such as general
  reconstruction code for non-Cartesian and PI reconstrcution. Also
  we are in need of investing some effort in the future development
  of the GUI towards python/Java.</p>
<p>We also need help with package maintenance for OpenSuSE, RedHat
  etc.</p>
<p>In any case <a href="mailto:k.vahedipour@fz-juelich.de">contact
 us</a> with a short description of your interest and coding
 background. With high hopes and best regards.</p>
