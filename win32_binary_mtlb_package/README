reduced JEMRIS win-package
- no parallelisation
- no coil-layout interface

Install:
 - put the folder in your matlab search path
 - avoid white-spaces in the path, also to the PWD

Usage:
 - run JEMRIS_seq and JEMRIS_sim from matlab
 - open example sequences epi.xml, tse.xml, gre.xml, analytic.xml
    * all of them are for 2D simulations prepared, i.e. no slice selection
    * analytic.xml just shows usage of anaytic pulses, and nonlinear gradients
